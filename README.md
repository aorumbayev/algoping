## About

### What is AlgoPing?

**1. Analytics Tweet Bot**:

AlgoPing is a daily cron triggered bot that uses [BitQuery](https://bitquery.io/) GraphQL API to fetch daily stats on total amount of block proposals and info on proposers. It then uses [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to post a tweet with the stats on daily basis to [@algoping](https://twitter.com/algoping) Twitter account.

**2. Health Monitoring Status Page**:

Additionally, AlgoPing uses [BetterUptime](https://betteruptime.com/) to monitor the status of Node and Indexer servers provided by [AlgoNode](https://algonode.io/) and [AlgoExplorer](https://algoexplorer.io/) respectively. Please note the status page is not affiliated with AlgoNode or AlgoExplorer, for official status refer to their respective websites and communication channels. The aim is to simply provide a free unnoficial status page for the Algorand community that aggregates different Node and Indexer Providers.

> Please note there are not source codes for health monitoring as AlgoPing relies on a free tier on a third party provider named [BetterUptime](https://betteruptime.com/). If you are interested in setting up your own health monitoring status page, please refer to [BetterUptime](https://betteruptime.com/) documentation.
